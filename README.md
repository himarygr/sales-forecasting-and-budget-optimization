# Time Series Analysis for Budget Optimization

**Project Overview**

The objective of this project is to predict 3 months of item-level sales data at different store locations and optimize budgets and placements to maximize key product metrics. We leverage time series analysis techniques to forecast sales, and then use these forecasts to optimize ad budgets for different placements. This project is a simplified representation of a real-world scenario where data-driven decisions are crucial for advertising campaigns.
